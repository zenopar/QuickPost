# QuickPost

> A fast, privacy-first, open-source API Client built for modern web developers.

QuickPost is a lightweight, distraction-free REST API client alternative to Postman. Built with speed and developer experience in mind, it allows you to compose HTTP requests, inspect responses in real-time, bypass browser CORS restrictions via Next.js Server Actions, and organize your API collections—all with local-first privacy.

## Features

- **Lightning Fast & Modern UI**: Sleek dark mode design optimized for productivity without bloated background services.
- **Full Request Builder**: Support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, custom headers, query params, and JSON/Form-data body payload.
- **Response Inspector**: Detailed HTTP status badges, response execution timing (in ms), payload size, formatted JSON viewer, and headers breakdown.
- **CORS Proxy via Server Actions**: Solve web browser CORS limitations seamlessly using Next.js Server Actions.
- **Built-in Rate Limiting**: Server Action protection preventing proxy abuse (IP-based limit).
- **Collections & Local History**: Automatically persist past requests locally in your browser storage.
